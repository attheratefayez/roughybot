## RoughyBot

A simple differential drive robot. 
It's already configured with [diff_drive_conrtoller](https://control.ros.org/rolling/doc/ros2_controllers/diff_drive_controller/doc/userdoc.html) and 
[joint_state_broadcaster](https://control.ros.org/rolling/doc/ros2_controllers/joint_state_broadcaster/doc/userdoc.html). 

This repository is not at all any project. Rather, this is a repository when you need to test something, e.g a new controller or a gazebo plugin maybe.
